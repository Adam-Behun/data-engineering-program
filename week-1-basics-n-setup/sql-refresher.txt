PostgreSQl refresher 
- Focus on JOINS and GROUP BY as those are used the most in data analysis
Sample analytical queries

Query 1

SELECT 
	tpep_pickup_datetime,
	tpep_dropoff_datetime,
	total_amount,
	CONCAT(zpu."Borough", ' / ', zpu."Zone") AS "pickup_loc",
	CONCAT(zdo."Borough", ' / ', zdo."Zone") AS "dropoff_loc"
FROM
	yellow_taxi_trips t JOIN zones zpu 
		ON t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID" 
	JOIN zones zdo 
		ON t."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"
LIMIT 100;

Query 2

SELECT 
	tpep_pickup_datetime,
	tpep_dropoff_datetime,
	total_amount,
	CONCAT(zpu."Borough", ' / ', zpu."Zone") AS "pickup_loc",
	CONCAT(zdo."Borough", ' / ', zdo."Zone") AS "dropoff_loc"
FROM
	yellow_taxi_trips t LEFT JOIN zones zpu 
		ON t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID" 
	LEFT JOIN zones zdo 
		ON t."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"
LIMIT 100;

Query 3

SELECT 
	CAST(tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE) as "day",
	"DOLocationID",
	COUNT(1) as "Count",
	MAX(total_amount) as "Amount",
	MAX(passenger_count) as "PassengerCount"
FROM
	yellow_taxi_trips t
GROUP BY
	1, 2
ORDER BY 
	"day" ASC,
	"DOLocationID" ASC;
